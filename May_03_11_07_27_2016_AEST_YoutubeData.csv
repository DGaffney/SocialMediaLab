How are you?

Recently I was surfing on Youtube. I come to know about your Youtube 
Channel. I have viewed so many of your videos. I become fan of your videos 
and style of making it and represent your ideas. 

I am so curious to know about How did you start this? please tell your story

Who did you inspire to motivate to make this amzing and useful videos.?

Why did you start this channel?

How many hours do you give in a week? do you work full time or work on 
weekends?

Which kind of opportunities do you start getting after making this videos?

How much money do you get from google adsense?

Is it good idea to make videos for full time?

What do you think if everyone start making their own youtube channel to 
teach something then what will be the future of education?

How much money did you invested to record and edit this videos?

Do you your own studio?

which tools do you use to record these videos and which software do you use 
for editing?


What message and tips do you like to inspire others to make educational 
youtube videos?﻿","Emilie Priyadarshini","0","0","2015-08-23T06:45:41.641Z","z12ji3fgpm2yjx3vz22mipkonnv3d3xma","None","FALSE","mL27TAJGlWc"
