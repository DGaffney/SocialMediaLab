# SocialMediaLab

`SocialMediaLab` is an R package that provides a suite of tools for collecting and constructing networks from social media data. It provides easy-to-use functions for collecting data across popular platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) and generating different types of networks for analysis.

SocialMediaLab was created by [Tim Graham](http://uq.academia.edu/TimGraham) (who is also the maintainer of the package) and [Robert Ackland](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/ackland-rj).

The latest 'official' version of the package can also be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SocialMediaLab/index.html).

This package would not be possible without key packages by other authors in the R community, notably....
